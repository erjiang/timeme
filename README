TimeMe.exe

This is a very simple timer written in VB.NET that counts up.  It has a
resolution of 1 second and is meant to let you keep track of roughly how long
something takes (like a coding project or something else).

The buttons are, from left to right:

    * play/pause: controls whether the timer is running or not
    * always on top: controls whether the window is above all other windows
    * exit: quits the program

All of the buttons also have tooltips.

By default, it minimizes to the system tray when you close the window.  Use the
red clock button to exit the program.
